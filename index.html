        <p> <strong>Passionate Researcher</strong>
          </em></p>
        <p>
          Hi there! I am a passionate and results-driven researcher with a diverse background in IoT, machine learning, and digital signal processing. Over the years, I have been fortunate to work on various intriguing projects, ranging from building innovative IoT solutions from scratch during my college days to implementing cutting-edge neural networks for training datasets.

Throughout my journey, I have taken great pride in developing and automating a robot using machine learning techniques, leveraging the power of digital signal processing for object distance measurement through canny edge detection, and working on lightweight authentication encryption systems to enhance DTLS security. Additionally, I have successfully applied my expertise to prevent DoS and MITM attacks on low-resource IoT devices, which has been truly rewarding.

In the field of machine learning, I have undertaken several projects, including stroke detection in humans, breast cancer detection, and developing a robust vaccination inventory system. These projects have allowed me to witness the true potential of AI in the medical domain and its impact on improving healthcare outcomes.

As a leader, I have guided and led more than 9 research projects that have been published in prestigious databases like Scopus and Web of Science. Currently, I am leading around 4 research projects, which will soon be published in respectable databases. The satisfaction of contributing valuable research to the academic community has been immensely fulfilling.

My diverse skillset includes proficiency in C/C++, Python, Linux, GitHub, MySQL, and Proteus, among others. However, my curiosity doesn't stop there. I am deeply fascinated by emerging technologies such as optical computing and optical neural networks. Exploring these cutting-edge areas excites me as they hold the potential to revolutionize computation and machine learning, paving the way for a new era of technology.

Currently, I am also deeply engaged in analyzing security tools like Emagnet and EvilGinx, and exploring the vast possibilities of drone technology research. I am starting my PhD soon within the domain of optical computing and optical neural networks. My passion for continuous learning drives me to stay at the forefront of technological advancements. 

I am eager to connect with like-minded professionals, collaborate on exciting projects, and make a meaningful impact on the world through technology and research. Let's connect and explore how we can together contribute to innovation and progress!
