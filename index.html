          I am a Geek in love with algorithms and hot black coffee. Computer Science is my passion, I love learning and researching new technologies, specifically related to IoT, ML, Cybersecurity and Robotics. I have been enjoying learning Web Development/Python/C++ to the depth. I have worked on multiple Microcontrollers/ML/AI/CyberSec projects in college in past 3 years utilising my C/C++/Python knowledge, for example using I2C protocol to communicate between arduino and lcd for master slave connection etc. Recently, I have finished working on research based on the detection and prevention of DoS and MITM attacks. And as it's said "There is no ending of learning", so just enjoying it.
        </p> 
        <p> In my undergraduate studies, I’ve taken on various leadership roles, including mentoring four research projects, coordinating institute-wide research events for hundreds of people, and leading many events. At the moment I have finished my fifth research work and sent it for publication.
