          I am a Geek in love with algorithms and hot black coffee. Computer Science is my passion, I love learning and researching new technologies, specifically related to IoT, ML, Cybersecurity and Robotics. I have been enjoying learning Web Development/Python/C++ to the depth. I have worked on multiple Microcontrollers/ML/AI/CyberSec projects in college in past 3 years utilising my C/C++/Python knowledge, for example using I2C protocol to communicate between arduino and lcd for master slave connection etc. Recently, I have finished working on research based on the detection and prevention of DoS and MITM attacks. And as it's said "There is no ending of learning", so just enjoying it.
        </p> 
        <p> In my undergraduate studies, I’ve taken on various leadership roles, including mentoring four research projects, coordinating institute-wide research events for hundreds of people, and leading many events. At the moment I have finished my fifth research work and sent it for publication.

Overall, as the primary author of this research work, I have contributed to the development of a novel security solution, BNIS, which can prevent and mitigate DoS attacks. My technical expertise in network security, system architecture, and programming, as well as my attention to detail and critical thinking, have been essential for the successful completion of this project. My research findings can have practical implications for the development of advanced security systems for computer networks, and contribute to the efforts to enhance the security and reliability of connected devices. The presentation of this research at the ICCAIS'2023 and publication in the Q1 journal Applied Computing and Informatics demonstrated the significance and impact of my work in the academic community.
